# **Dimensional-Modelling-Snowflake**

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates how to build a cloud-based dimensional data warehouse using **Snowflake**, with data stored in an **Amazon S3 bucket**. The objective is to transform raw datasets into an efficient star schema for analytical querying and generate actionable business insights. By leveraging Snowflake's capabilities such as staging areas and dimensional modeling, this project provides a scalable and structured approach to managing large datasets.

## **Key Components**

### **1. Amazon S3 Connection**
The raw data files are stored in an **Amazon S3 bucket**, which serves as the external source for Snowflake. The connection to S3 is established using Snowflake's `STAGE` feature, enabling secure and efficient data transfer.



### **2. Stage Area Usage**
The **stage area** in Snowflake acts as an intermediary between the S3 bucket and the Snowflake tables. This area is used to manage and preview data before loading it into the data warehouse.

#### Advantages:
- **Reusable Configuration**: A single stage can be used to load multiple datasets from the same S3 bucket.
- **File Management**: The stage allows you to preview available files and ensure data consistency.
- **Improved Security**: Credentials and access permissions are managed securely, minimizing risks during data ingestion.


### **3. Dimensional Modeling**
The data warehouse is structured into a **star schema**, which separates business facts from descriptive attributes, ensuring efficient and intuitive querying. 

#### Components of the Star Schema:
- **Fact Table**: Captures transactional data, such as product orders, user actions, and purchase details.
- **Dimension Tables**: Provide descriptive context to the fact table, such as product details, user information, order metadata, and hierarchical attributes like departments and aisles.

#### Benefits of Dimensional Modeling:
- **Optimized Query Performance**: The star schema simplifies complex joins and enhances query performance.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Data is organized in an intuitive way, making it easier for business analysts to navigate and query.
- **Scalability**: The schema can be extended by adding new dimensions or facts without disrupting existing queries.

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Integration**:
   - Data files are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.
   - A Snowflake stage is created to connect to the S3 bucket and facilitate data loading.

2. **Data Loading**:
   - Data is ingested from the stage area into raw staging tables in Snowflake.
   - Each dataset is carefully processed to ensure data integrity and consistency.

3. **Dimensional Modeling**:
   - Raw data is transformed into a **star schema** consisting of one fact table and several dimension tables.
   - Dimension tables provide descriptive attributes, while the fact table captures transactional details.

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - Analytical queries are executed on the dimensional model to derive insights such as reorder patterns, product demand, and user purchase behavior.





## **Conclusion**
This project illustrates the power of combining Snowflake and Amazon S3 for building a scalable and efficient dimensional data warehouse. By using best practices in data integration, staging, and dimensional modeling, the project transforms raw datasets into actionable insights, enabling better decision-making and business intelligence. Whether you are analyzing reorder patterns or exploring customer behavior, this solution is designed to handle large-scale datasets with ease and efficiency.
